PayLES uses official U.S. government and DoD datasets and calculations to provide estimates based on the information provided by the user, however each user's situation is unique and all factors cannot be accounted for. Historical analysis and testing has shown that PayLES is accurate to within 2.2% of the official military pay for approximately 95% of users. This means that for the vast majority of users, the estimates provided by PayLES will be very close to their actual future pay. The estimates provided by PayLES are not a substitute for official military pay statements or financial advice. Users should verify their own financial information and consult with their finance office for any discrepancies or concerns."
