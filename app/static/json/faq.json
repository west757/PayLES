        "content": "PayLES is a free and open-source web application designed to help United States military service members analyze their finances using their Leave and Earnings Statement (LES). Learn more at the <a href='about'>about</a> page!"

    {
        "label": "How do I use PayLES?",
        "content": "First, upload your latest LES file on the home page, and the application will parse the data and display your current pay. You can then adjust your future finances based on anticipated changes such as promotions, moves, or changes in dependents. The application will calculate your future pay for up to 12 months based on the information provided."

        "label": "How do I get an LES?",
        "content": "An LES is provided to all military service members at the end of each month. It can be accessed through the <a href=\"https://mypay.dfas.mil/\" target=\"_blank\">MyPay</a> website or through your unit's finance office. If you are unsure how to access your LES, please contact your unit's finance office for assistance."

        "label": "Is PayLES secure?",
        "content": "PayLES is as secure as any other web application. It does not store any user data, and all data is processed in-memory without saving to disk. The application does not require any user accounts or personal information, ensuring user privacy and security. PayLES also uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, providing an extra layer of security. <br><br> With PayLES being open-source, every single line of code is available for anyone to review, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. The source code is all hosted on GitHub. Additionally, the developer is commited to maintaining the security and privacy of the application as technology updates, and will promptly address any security vulnerabilities or concerns that may arise."

        "label": "LES documents have PII data, how does PayLES handle this?",
        "content": "PayLES does not read any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data - the name and last four of SSN - from the LES. All data that is read is captured only from specific bounding boxes on the pdf which are described in the les_rectangles.csv file. Additionally, the pdf is converted into a png image for display on the page with the rectangle modal overlays. During this conversion, the name and SSN have whiteout applied to ensure that no PII data is displayed."

        "label": "How accurate is PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES strives to be as accurate as possible, however is unable to guarantee 100% accuracy of the calculations. PayLES uses official U.S. government and DoD datasets and calculations to provide estimates based on the information provided by the user, however each user's situation is unique and all factors cannot be accounted for. Additionally, PayLES has limitations in determining whether certain pay is an error or not which means that payment mistakes may go unrecognized or treated as being accurate. <br><br> Historical analysis and testing has shown that PayLES is accurate to within 2.5% of the official military pay for approximately 90% of users. This means that for the vast majority of users, the estimates provided by PayLES will be very close to their actual future pay."

    {
        "label": "Was any AI used to make PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES is made with the help of Github Copilot using GPT-4.1 LLM. Copilot is used because GitHub is already being used to host and version control the project, it's easily integrated into the Visual Studio Code IDE, and overall is an effective tool helping speed up development. Copilot was only used for code generation, documentation, and providing suggestions for improving the quality of the codebase. However, approximately 50% of the code was written without Copilot, and of the code that was generated about half would have been written regardless of Copilot's assistance. All ideas, core logic, and design decisions were made by the developer."

    {
        "label": "What is the future roadmap for PayLES?",
        "content": "The current focus is on improving the user experience by ensuring high accuracy, expanding the amount of unique use cases captured, and maintaining up to date datasets. For the long-term, the developer would like to explore the possibility of having PayLES become an official DoD application. The goal of this would be to increase accessibility, availability, and accuracy of the program, especially if it was able to be integrated into MyPay and supported by DFAS. <br><br> There are currently no plans to incorporate mobile support, whether through mobile browsing or an app."

        "label": "Who developed PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES is solely developed by me, Mike West. I am an active duty engineering officer in the United States Air Force, and work on this project off-duty in my spare time. I originally did not have my name associated with this project since I wished to remain anonymous for privacy reasons and the fact that I do not intend to achieve any fame, recognition, or money from PayLES. This project is strictly for the benefit of other military members, I will never put ads or use it for personal gain. However, I have since decided to include my name in the project as I believe it's important to be transparent about who is behind this project and to take full responsibility for its development and maintenance. If you have any questions or concerns about PayLES, please feel free to contact me through GitHub. I welcome all feedback!"

        "label": "How can I contribute to this project?",
        "content": "The best way to contribute to this project is by just simply spreading the word! If you find PayLES useful, please share it with others. The more people who use PayLES means the more feedback received and improvements made. <br><br> I also welcome all technical contributions, whether reporting any bugs or issues, suggesting new features, or providing feedback on the user experience. If you would like to contribute code, please feel free to submit a pull request on GitHub. <br><br> However, if you are non-technical but are truly determined to make an impactful contribution, please consider making a donation to a military charity on behalf of PayLES. Some of my favorite charities include the <a href=\"https://www.uso.org/\" target=\"_blank\">USO</a> and <a href=\"https://fisherhouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fisher House Foundation</a>, but there are many great organizations that are always in need of support. <br><br> Thank you."
