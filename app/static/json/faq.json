        "content": "PayLES is a free and open-source web application designed to help United States military service members analyze their finances using their Leave and Earnings Statement (LES). Learn more at the <a href='about'>about</a> page!"
    },
    {
        "label": "How do I use PayLES?",
        "content": "First, upload your latest LES file on the home page, and PayLES will parse the data and display your current pay. You can then adjust your future finances based on anticipated changes such as promotions, moves, or changes in dependents. The application will calculate your future pay for up to 12 months based on the information provided. To see more instructions, please submit an example LES on the home page and click the instructions button, which will further describe the functionality of PayLES."

    {
        "label": "How do I get an LES?",
        "content": "An LES is provided to all military service members at the end of each month. It can be accessed through the <a href=\"https://mypay.dfas.mil/\" target=\"_blank\">MyPay</a> website or through your unit's finance office. If you are unsure how to access your LES, please contact your unit's finance office for assistance."

        "label": "Is PayLES secure?",
        "content": "PayLES is as secure as any other web application. It does not store any user data, and all data is processed in-memory without saving to disk. The application does not require any user accounts or personal information, ensuring user privacy and security. PayLES also uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, providing an extra layer of security. <br><br> With PayLES being open-source, every single line of code is available for anyone to review, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. The source code is all hosted on GitHub. Additionally, the developer is commited to maintaining the security and privacy of the application as technology updates and will promptly address any security vulnerabilities or concerns that may arise."
    },
    {
        "label": "LES documents have personal information, how does PayLES handle this?",
        "content": "PayLES does not read any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, name and SSN, from the LES. All data read in is captured only from specific bounding boxes on the LES which are described in the les_rectangles.csv file. Additionally, the pdf is converted into a png image for display on the page with the rectangle modal overlays. During this conversion, the name and SSN have whiteout applied over them, and the png is flattened to ensure that data cannot be extracted."

    {
        "label": "What are the limitations of PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES has several limitations that users should be aware of. First, PayLES does not store any user data, meaning that all data is lost upon refreshing or closing the browser. Users must re-upload their LES and re-enter any adjustments each time they visit the site. To help mitigate this, the export feature allows users to download their entire budget as an excel or CSV file for offline use. <br><br> Secondly, PayLES does not currently take age into account when performing TSP calculations. Age matters when contributing to a TSP account, such as increasing contribution limits for those over 50 and 60. There are no plans to make this a feature as only approximately 6% of the military is over 50, and doesn't seem necessary as the increased limit can easily be hand-calculated.<br><br> Third, PayLES does not conduct pro-rated calculations, it treats all months as the same. This means that changes which occur in the middle of the month may not be accurately reflected in the calculations. For example, if a user promotes in the middle of the month, their pay will either display the current month as having the full promotion, or the next month. Difficulty of implementation is the largest factor preventing this feature. <br><br> Fourth, PayLES is not designed for transactions tracking to get actuals, like adding to your monthly gas total each time you fill up your vehicle. It does not tie into any banking institution to see your as-is accounts and transactions, sacrificing convenience and accuracy for simplicity and security. There are no plans to integrate bank accounts and transaction tracking. <br><br> And finally, PayLES does not account for all possible pay scenarios and may not be able to accurately estimate pay for users with very unique situations. This is further elaborated in the following FAQ."

    {
        "label": "How accurate is PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES strives to be as accurate as possible, however is unable to guarantee 100% accuracy of the calculations. PayLES uses official U.S. government and DoD datasets and algorithms to provide estimates based on the information provided by the user, however each user's situation is unique and all factors cannot be accounted for. The largest causes of deviations are surrounding edge cases such as unique OCONUS assignments, unpaid deductions, and special National Guard drill calculations. Additionally, PayLES has limitations in determining whether certain pay is an error or not, sometimes resulting in payment mistakes going unrecognized or treated as being accurate."
    },
    {
        "label": "Are there alternatives to PayLES?",
        "content": "There are currently no other applications (to the best of the developer's knowledge) that provide the same level of functionality as PayLES. There are several commercial budgeting applications available, such as <a href=\"https://www.ynab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YNAB</a> and <a href=\"https://actualbudget.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Actual</a>, however these applications do not specifically cater to military service members and do not provide the same level of detail and accuracy in estimating military pay. <br><br> There are also several military-specific financial planning resources available, however these resources do not provide the same level of interactivity and customization as PayLES. Examples include the <a href=\"https://www.military.com/benefits/military-pay/calculator\" target=\"_blank\">Military.com Military Pay Calculator</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.federalpay.org/military/calculator?grade=E-1&years_experience=2+or+less&year=2024&zip=&is_dependent=0&annualize=1&service=Army\" target=\"_blank\">FederalPay.org Pay Calculator</a>, and <a href=\"https://cdcalculators.com/army-pay-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">CDCalculators Army Pay Tool</a>. <br><br> The developer recommends using a personal budgeting application in conjunction with PayLES to help track actual expenses and manage finances. Furthermore, it's encouraged to check out the other military-specific pay calculators to provide validation against PayLES."

    {
        "label": "Was any AI used to make PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES is made with the help of Github Copilot using GPT-4.1 LLM. Copilot is used because GitHub is providing hosting capabilities and version control for the project, it's easily integrated into the Visual Studio Code IDE, and overall is an effective tool helping speed up development. Copilot was only used for code generation, documentation, and providing suggestions for improving the quality of the codebase. However, approximately 50% of the code was written without Copilot, and of the code that was generated about half would have been written regardless of Copilot's assistance. All ideas, core logic, and design decisions were made by the developer."

    {
        "label": "What is the future roadmap for PayLES?",
        "content": "The current focus is on improving the user experience by ensuring high accuracy, expanding the amount of unique use cases captured, and maintaining up to date datasets. For the long-term, the developer would like to explore the possibility of having PayLES become an official DoD application. The goal of this would be to increase accessibility, availability, and accuracy of the program, especially if it was able to be supported by DFAS. <br><br> There are currently no plans to incorporate mobile support, whether through mobile browsing or an app. Having user accounts that save the budget allowing for convenient future access is also not being considered at this time. The scope is also going to remain focused on military pay, and not expand so far into personal budgeting such as tracking individual expenses over a monthly period."

        "label": "Who developed PayLES?",
        "content": "PayLES is solely developed by me, Mike West. I am an active duty engineering officer in the United States Air Force, and work on this project entirely off-duty in my spare time. I have spent well over 500 hours on this project, ranging from design, programming, testing, and most time-consuming, research. I originally did not have my name associated with this project since I wished to remain anonymous for privacy reasons and the fact that I do not intend to achieve any fame, recognition, or money from PayLES. This project is strictly for the benefit of other military members, I will never put ads or use it for personal gain. However, I have since decided to include my name in the project as I believe it's important to be transparent about who is behind this project and to take full responsibility for its development and maintenance. If you have any questions or concerns about PayLES, please feel free to contact me through GitHub. I welcome all feedback!"

        "label": "How can I contribute to this project?",
        "content": "The best way to contribute to this project is by just simply spreading the word! If you find PayLES useful, please share it with others. The more people who use PayLES means the more feedback received and improvements made. <br><br> I also welcome all technical contributions, whether reporting any bugs or issues, suggesting new features, or providing feedback on the user experience. If you would like to contribute code, please feel free to submit a pull request on GitHub. <br><br> However, if you are non-technical but are truly determined to make an impactful contribution, please consider making a donation to a military charity on behalf of PayLES. Some of my favorite charities include the <a href=\"https://www.uso.org/\" target=\"_blank\">USO</a> and <a href=\"https://fisherhouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fisher House Foundation</a>, but there are many great organizations that are always in need of support. <br><br> Thank you."
