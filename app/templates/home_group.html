            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> PayLES is not an official Department of Defense (DoD) or U.S. military service 
            application. It is a personal project developed by an active duty service member for educational and budgetary 
            awareness. The information provided by PayLES is for informational purposes only and should not be considered

            <strong>Note:</strong> PayLES strives to be as accurate as possible, however is unable to guarantee 100% accuracy 
            of the calculations. PayLES uses official U.S. government and DoD datasets and calculations to provide estimates 
            based on the information provided by the user, however each user's situation is unique and all factors cannot be 
            accounted for. Historical analysis and testing has shown that PayLES is accurate to within 2.2% of the official 
            military pay for approximately 95% of users. This means that for the vast majority of users, the estimates provided 
            by PayLES will be very close to their actual future pay. The estimates provided by PayLES are not a substitute for 
            official military pay statements or financial advice. Users should verify their own financial information and 
            consult with their finance office for any discrepancies or concerns.
